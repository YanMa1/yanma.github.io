I am a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu), advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Bi](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~xiaojun/). I obtained my B.S. in computer science from [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/) and a B.S. in applied mathematics from [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn/). My research interests focus on Human-Computer Interaction, particularly in human performance modeling, VR/XR interaction techniques, and human-centered generative AI. Currently, I'm working on developing LLMs-based interaction techniques to improve user performance and experience.
